# Zbalermorna Upright Font

A readable zbalermorna font that makes heavvy use of ligatures to render letter combinations. Some regular characters have been draw to match the writing system. Somethings are currently omitted from the font:

* up, down, u-d, and d-u intonations (numbers ingare numbers sell out in lojban)
* a good system for rendering dynamics/stretch/silence
* a way to render/semi-vowels CAS correctly - some advanced ligatures (eg `.i'i`) aren't supported for some reason

*see [ZLM4_Writeup_v2.pdf](/ZLM4_Writeup_v2.pdf) for all details on Zbalermorna.*
